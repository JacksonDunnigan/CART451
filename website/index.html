                You're a conflicted individual, a double dipped pen, crumpled newsprint and a cardstock abstraction,with the latter, your goal. Your soul thrives on unspooling unconventional thought, where words and intent symphonically merge to chaotic colors and shapes of unspoken stories of people you can vaguely assign to faces or feelings. You speak in the language of the abstract, weaving narratives that challenge convention and defy the ordinary. Eclecticism transcending boundaries, finding beauty in the unconventional and solace in the dissonant. In your journey, you invite others to explore with you, uncovering the mysteries of this captivating world of boundless expression.              </p>

                Wikipedia embodies the pinnacle of crowdsourcing, illustrating the potential of decentralized collaboration to curate and share knowledge on an unprecedented scale. It is a testament to the collective intelligence of a global community, pooling their diverse expertise to construct a vast, ever-evolving encyclopedia. Jeff Howe's article "The Rise of Crowdsourcing" provides a broader lens on the phenomenon, elucidating how crowdsourcing extends beyond knowledge creation, encompassing diverse applications such as problem-solving, innovation, and collective creativity. On the other hand, Lauren Lee McCarthy's work often employs crowdsourcing and technology to delve into the dynamics of human interaction and intimacy. While Wikipedia stands as an exemplary crowdsourced knowledge repository, McCarthy's art highlights the potential of crowdsourcing in eliciting critical reflections on societal connections and the influence of technology on contemporary human experiences. Both Wikipedia and McCarthy's work underscore the transformative impact of crowdsourcing, whether in knowledge creation or in redefining social and artistic paradigms.

                AI is a powerful creative tool, challenging the conventional idea of individual authorship, pushing us to reconsider creative dynamics. As someone whose practice extends to a multitude of mediums, encompassing poetry, painting, coding, and music production, reflection on issues of ownership, authorship and collaboration are vital to my craft. In an artistic sense, many view AI as a rehash of stolen ideas while others view it as a parallel to the human mind, merging influences into something new. While in most cases, I view AI art as the former, though the latter does have its points. Like for one, if the work is open about its usage of AI, and the data it was trained on is shared alongside, it can be reminiscent of an artist discussing their influences.The corresponding issue to this though, is AI is not actually intelligent, and it isn't trained by artist to benefit artists, so it is nearly impossible to find its data's origin.              </p>
