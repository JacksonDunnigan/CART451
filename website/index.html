                In this interview between Guardian Journalist, Zoë Corbyn and MIT assistant professor, Catherine D'Ignazio, the latter discusses the concept of "Data Feminism" and its importance in addressing biases and discrimination prevalent in data science and AI. D'Ignazio emphasizes that data is not neutral and often reflects societal biases, including sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination. The aim of Data Feminism is to approach data science through an intersectional feminist lens, considering all forms of inequality throughout the data processing pipeline. The article highlights how certain groups, especially women and people of colour, are disproportionately affected by biased data and flawed algorithms. An example being how United States historical crime data is lopsided towards people of colour due to American over-policing and patrolling in neighbourhoods of colour. Another rather funny term used in the interview is "Big Dick Data," which refers to large-scale data projects prioritizing size and speed over quality and context—often neglecting inclusivity and inequalities. The interview ends by encouraging readers to critically question the origin and implications of data, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where issues of missing and biased data have emerged at an unprecedentedly high level.              </p>

                Wikipedia embodies the pinnacle of crowdsourcing, illustrating the potential of decentralized collaboration to curate and share knowledge on an unprecedented scale. It is a testament to the collective intelligence of a global community, pooling their diverse expertise to construct a vast, ever-evolving encyclopedia. Jeff Howe's article "The Rise of Crowdsourcing" provides a broader lens on the phenomenon, elucidating how crowdsourcing extends beyond knowledge creation, encompassing diverse applications such as problem-solving, innovation, and collective creativity. On the other hand, Lauren Lee McCarthy's work often employs crowdsourcing and technology to delve into the dynamics of human interaction and intimacy. While Wikipedia stands as an exemplary crowdsourced knowledge repository, McCarthy's art highlights the potential of crowdsourcing in eliciting critical reflections on societal connections and the influence of technology on contemporary human experiences. Both Wikipedia and McCarthy's work underscore the transformative impact of crowdsourcing, whether in knowledge creation or in redefining social and artistic paradigms.
